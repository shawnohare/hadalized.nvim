# Introduction

hadalized.nvim: A darker Solarized-inspired Lush Theme for neovim that uses the
okhsl color space. The name references the
[oceanic hadopelagic zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadal_zone)
to emphasize our preference of a darker background and a homage to the
original choice of Solarized's blue.

# Differenes from Solarized

Hadalized takes Solarized as an inspiration for the basic choices but
diverges in a number of significant ways.

Perhaps most significantly, hadalized uses the `okhsl` colorspace with
fixed lightness for colors palettes.

- The dark background bases are shifted toward darker variants.
- Orange is made more distinct from red.
