# Introduction

hadalized.nvim: A darker Solarized-inspired Lush Theme for neovim 0.8+ that uses the
okhsl color space. The name references the
[oceanic hadopelagic zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadal_zone)
to emphasize our preference of a darker background and a homage to the
original choice of Solarized's blue.

# Differenes from Solarized

Hadalized takes Solarized as an inspiration for the basic choices but
diverges in a number of ways.

- Utilize the `okhsl` colorspace with fixed lightness for colors palettes.
- Base dark backgrounds are shifted toward darker variants.
- Base foregrounds are less saturated, ergo more neutrally gray.
- Add "spring" color as a green variant.
- Add "rose" color as a magenta variant.
- Orange is made more distinct from red.
