# Builder for hadalized-like themes

A hadalized-like theme is any theme that uses the same color and
highlight group variable names. This builder takes the
theme configuration defining the colors and outputs application
specific themes rendered from templates, similar to base16 builders.

For now this is just a way for me to keep my main theme definitions in
a single location.
